## Co-working Space Design

---
### Description
The space (company title Co-Work) is a vibrant and funky co-working space that has been newly remodeled. The general feel is high-end but welcoming, safe, and comfortable for a range of professionals. The space has multiple amenities including high-speed internet, communal and private offices, printing and faxing services, a coffee counter, and fun Thursday afternoon activities.

The goal of this project is to create a web interface that embodies these ideals of Co-Work. The site must be easy to use and navigate for a diverse user group, and must show the personality of Co-Work. Careful thought was given to fonts and coloring in particular. The design was occasionally evaluated for simplicity. If an area was too busy, elements were removed to keep the design clean.

### User Stories
##### Tech Workers:
*Goals of use:* Identify Co-Work as a comfortable, QUIET space to work. Identify amenities. Ability to easily book a conference room and see availability. Identifying Thursday activities in advance.

*Motivation:* Compare Co-Work with other co-working spaces, especially amenities.

*Pain Points:* No ease of seeing conference room availability, unreadable interface that sometimes selects wrong time (real we-work example). Coffee running out. App not sleek enough to catch developer's attention (or having bugs). Co-working in communal spaces can be riddled with distractions, especially noise.

*Technical ability:* Proficient to Expert

*Common Devices:* Computer likely, since they will have their computers with them and open most of the time.


##### Daytraders and Business people:
*Goals of use:* Identify Co-Work as a comfortable, professional space to work in a good area for business. Identify amenities. Ability to easily book a private room for meeting with clients, or conference room for presentations.

*Motivation:* Book rooms when needed. Compare Co-Work with other co-working spaces, especially amenities.

*Pain Points:* No ease of seeing conference room availability. Information not displayed clearly. Co-working in communal spaces can be riddled with distractions, especially noise.

*Technical ability:* Beginner to Expert

*Common Devices:* Computer or smartphone likely. Most have computers but check email on phone on the go.


##### Counselors and others with clients:
*Goals of use:* Identify Co-Work as a comfortable, professional space to work in that will be comfortable for clients. Identify amenities. Ability to know they have a private room available when needed. *Possibly ability for clients to book with them through Co-Work interface, or leave feedback.*

*Motivation:* Book rooms when needed (frequently). Insure Co-Work is safe and welcoming for clientele. Compare Co-Work with other co-working spaces. Extra amenities less important than client impressions.

*Pain Points:* Overbooked private rooms. Interface not welcoming to clients/temporary user of space.

*Technical ability:* Beginner to Proficient

*Common Devices:* Computer or smartphone likely. Most have computers but check email on phone on the go.


##### Artists and Craftspeople:
*Goals of use:* Identify Co-Work as a comfortable, fun, motivating space. Know that Co-Work has areas to sit/chat/drink coffee. Identify amenities. Identify a place within Co-Work to store supplies, possibly with ability to reserve this space through interface.

*Motivation:* Find a co-working space that is FOR THEM, not just about tech workers. Reserve storage space for supplies.

*Pain Points:* Inability to know if they will have storage space available. Not knowing who you'll be working near (other artists who want to chat? Techies who want a quiet space?)

*Technical ability:* Beginner to Proficient

*Common Devices:* Smartphone most likely, not all with have computers with them. Easier to check a phone when working on a craft (saves bench space).

##### Site managers and administrators:
*Goals of use:* Ability to make changes to the site. Easily post/edit Thursday afternoon activities. Edit availability of private spaces. See metrics (e.g. How many artists? How often is conference room A used?)

*Motivation:* Showcase features of their co-working space and their personality. Allow their clients (i.e. workers) easy access to rooms/storage/etc.. Showcase upcoming fun activities (requires frequent editing).

*Pain Points:* Editing of Thursday activities unintuitive. Metrics not clear.

*Technical ability:* Beginner to Proficient, best to assume beginner when designing for this group

*Common Devices:* Smartphone likely, especially for checking metrics on-the-go. Computer more likely for updating site.

## Brainstorm

Site needs to look sophisticated but accessible. Hipster, in cursive. Classy, in fun colors. Site should elicit the smell of coffee.

http://www.theurbanhive.com/ is a *very good* example of this aesthetic. Full-sized image banner of space makes it look large and comfortable. Muted colors in image with white text = luxury. The fonts have been picked carefully. A concluding banner's text "YOU BELONG HERE" is welcoming.

https://www.greenspaces.com/ is a *good* example of using lots of white space. One banner, followed by a "as recommended in" list, followed by pictures and blurbs from the CEOs. Their pictures and burbs make them seem friendly and easily accessible. 3D tour shows full facility. I like this one because they don't seem like the have anything to hide; very un-corporate.

https://cohoots.com/ is a *bad* example of the look Co-Work should have. It's got too many bright colors in hard-edge boxes that the space comes off as corporate and busy. Uninviting. One thing that does work is the use of fun icons and keywords ("boost productivity") for amenities.

Pulling from these and other examples for inspiration, I believe Co-Work's site should use a color scheme of grey + one main color + one complementary color maximum, and white should be prevalent. Font need to be carefully chosen. One sans-serif font for the body text for a clean, hip look and one fancier text for headings for luxury/sophistication.

Images provided should be large, maybe somewhat transparent with lettering on top. Most images contain plants, these should show on sides of page to give the idea that at Co-Work, you'll be in a natural environment.

Button to sign up/inquire about pricing shouldn't be too in your face. Community emphasized. Amenity icons clean and clear.

Interface for reserving rooms (if this is included) clear, and easy to use.
